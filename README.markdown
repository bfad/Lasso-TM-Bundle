Lasso TextMate Bundle
=====================

Lasso is an excellent programming language with a long history in being used for web development. It deserves an excellent bundle for TextMate, and that's exactly what I plan to give it.

## Installation Using Git

All you need to do is issue the following command from the command line:

$> git clone git://github.com/bfad/Lasso-TM-Bundle.git ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles/Lasso.tmbundle

To update to the latest version of the bundle:

$> cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles/Lasso.tmbundle
$> git pull


## Manual Installation

To manually download and install this bundle, follow these steps:

1. Click the Downloads button on the repository homepage (https://github.com/bfad/Lasso-TM-Bundle)

2. Download and decompress the zip file

3. When you decompress the zip file, you'll see a folder named something like "bfad-Lasso-TM-Bundle-8f8ec88"

4. Rename this folder to Lasso.tmbundle

5. Once you do that, if you have TextMate installed, it should recognize it as a package. Double click the newly named Lasso.tmbundle and it should launch TextMate and install it for you
